Here are some interesting experiences in computational mathematics that I have experienced.

## Nonlinear Optimization

I took a course in Nonlinear Optimization.  This course covered constrained optimization, numerical optimization, variational problems, and convex optimization.  My code for the numerical optimization have been provided below.

### [Update Directions](https://github.com/NonDairyNeutrino/Nonlinear_Optimization/blob/master/Chapman_Update_Directions.py)

In this code we implement the [Fletcher-Reeves method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_conjugate_gradient_method) for our nonlinear conjugate gradient descent, and a [backtracking line search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking_line_search) based on the Armijoâ€“Goldstein condition.

### [Line Search Methods](https://github.com/NonDairyNeutrino/Nonlinear_Optimization/blob/master/Line_Search_Methods_Chapman.py)

In this code we implement a [line search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_search) with [backtracking/Armijo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking_line_search) and [Newton method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method_in_optimization).
