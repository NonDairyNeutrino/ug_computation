# Effects of Eccentricity on the Precession of Orbital Periapsides due to General Relativity in the Weak Field Limit

This project was originally written for my Physics 486: Computational Physics course and aims to simulate the precession of Mercury's perihelion due to General Relativity.

## Abstract

Mercury's close proximity to the Sun and relatively high eccentricity make it the only object in the solar system to exhibit significant general relativistic (GR) perihelion precession. Due to not having more observational data, we must resort to simulating how eccentricity changes the relativistic precession of an orbiting body's periapsis (the point in a body's orbit that is closest to the object in which it is orbiting). Since the Sun is only massive enough to display weak GR
effects, and Mercury is far enough away, the gravitational interaction is modeled via perturbing (i.e. adding a small variation to) Newton's inverse-square law of gravity/modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). To fully describe the physics of the system, I investigate how the rate of precession due to General Relativity varies as a function of eccentricity. This data is analyzed to show how the rate of energy loss in the star-planet system due to the emission of gravitational radiation
(gravitational waves/ripples in spacetime) varies with respect to the eccentricity of the planet's orbit. This information is then used to see how the eccentricity affects the time it takes for the planet to collide with the star. As a corollary, using it's parameters, Mercury's rate of precession is found to match the known value, thus confirming General Relativity is the current best explanation for Mercury's anomalous perihelion precession.
